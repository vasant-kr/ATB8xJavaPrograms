    /*
    Arrays is a collection of data of similar type - Homogenous data structure.
    Arrays are objects in Java.
    Stored in Contiguous(continuous) memory
    Arrays can be constructed with multiple dimensions - 1-D, 2-D Array etc.
    index based - always

    How to create Array:
    1. int [] myArray = {1,2,3,4,5}; -> Fixed size array/Declared Elements.

    2. int[] marks = new int[5];
    marks[0]=100;
    marks[1] = 20;

    Access the elements by using indexes.

    Functions in Array:
    1. array.length();
    2. Arrays.sort(marks);

    In Arrays we can also do Binary Search:
    int item = Arrays.binarySearch(marks, 20);

    Binary search only works on Sorted Array.

    Arrays limitations:
    1. Size is fixed.
    2. Only stores same data type values.
    3. Addition and deletion is difficult to handle in Arrays as it is index based, and we need to shift other elements.


    These limitations are fixed by ArrayList.
