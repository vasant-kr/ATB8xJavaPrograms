Difference between Exception and Error:
Both are an event in program that occurs during the execution tha disrupts the normal flow of instructions.
Exceptions can be handled. Errors cant be handled. Eg. MemoryOverflow

Exceptions can be handled by:
1. Try and Catch(finally) blocks
2. Throws


Exceptions types:
1. Checked - If JVM knows about it (RuntimeException) - Eg, FileNotFoundException, SQlException, IOException, ClassNotFoundException
2. Unchecked -  If JVM doesnt know about it Eg, / by Zero, ArithmeticExecption, arrayOutOfBoundException, NullPointerException

Exception has a parent class- Throwable
Object is the Super class of everything3

We can have multiple try blocks
We can have multiple catch blocks
We can catch multiple exceptions in single line by using '|'
catch(Arithmetic Exception | Exception e)

throw is used to throw a new type of custom exception
Eg.
throw new Exception("blah blah blah");
multiple throw not allowed for a try or function

throws mean that this function can throw any exception.
To declare an exception
multiple throws are allowed

We can throw an exception, error, throwable

finally block is for always executing even if an exception occurs
