Exceptions can be handled by:
1. Try and Catch(finally) blocks
2. Throws


Exceptions types:
1. Checked - If JVM knows about it - Eg, FileNotFoundException, SQlException, IOException, ClassNotFoundException
2. Unchecked -  If JVM doesnt know about it Eg, / by Zero, ArithmeticExecption, arrayOutOfBoundException, NullPointerException

Exception has a parent class- Throwable
Object is the Super class of everything3

We can have multiple try blocks
We can have multiple catch blocks
We can catch multiple exceptions in single line by using '|'
catch(Arithmetic Exception | Exception e)
